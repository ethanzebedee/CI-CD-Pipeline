## 🛠️ Technologies

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using the following
technologies:

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for building the application
- **Express** - Web framework for the application
- **Jest** - Testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **ESLint** - Static code analysis for maintaining code quality
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent deployment
- **GitHub Actions** - Automation of CI/CD workflows
- **npm** - Package management and script execution

The technology choices were made to create a modern, maintainable pipeline
that follows industry best practices.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline follows these stages:

```mermaid
Code Changes → Test → Build → (Future: Deploy)
```

### Continuous Integration

1. **Code Validation**
   - Linting with ESLint
   - Static code analysis

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Integration tests for API endpoints

3. **Build**
   - Docker image creation
   - Verification of the container functionality

### Continuous Deployment (Future Implementation)

- Automated deployment to staging/production environments
- Infrastructure as Code principles

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Docker
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CI-CD-Pipeline.git
cd CI-CD-Pipeline

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Access the application
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ci-cd-pipeline .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 ci-cd-pipeline

# Access the application
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The project implements a comprehensive testing strategy:

### Unit Testing

- Tests individual components in isolation
- Uses Jest for assertions and test running
- Properly mocks dependencies

### Integration Testing

- Tests API endpoints using Supertest
- Verifies correct HTTP responses
- Ensures the application handles requests properly

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## 🐳 Docker Containerization

The application is containerized using Docker with the following approach:

- **Base Image**: Node.js 18 Alpine for minimal size
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized for production use
- **Best Practices**:
  - Separate dependency installation from code copying for better layer caching
  - Non-root user for security
  - Proper port exposure
  - Minimal included files using .dockerignore

The Dockerfile is structured to create reproducible builds and ensure
consistent behavior across different environments.

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented with GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. **Triggers on**:
   - Push to main branch
   - Pull requests to main branch

2. **Test Job**:
   - Sets up Node.js environment
   - Installs dependencies with caching
   - Runs linting checks
   - Executes test suite

3. **Build Job**:
   - Only runs after successful tests
   - Sets up Docker Buildx
   - Implements layer caching for faster builds
   - Builds the Docker image
   - Verifies the container works correctly

Key features:

- Efficient caching of npm and Docker layers
- Separation of concerns between jobs
- Proper error handling and reporting

## 🔮 Future Improvements

The pipeline could be extended with:

1. **Automated Deployments**
   - Integration with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Blue/Green deployment strategy

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Code coverage reports
   - Performance testing
   - Security scanning

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Integration with monitoring tools
   - Logging enhancements
   - Application performance monitoring

4. **Additional Quality Gates**
   - SonarQube for code quality
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - License compliance checks
